A Markov model of a person's tendency to exercise or not. A Markov process has:

* a finite set of states
* fixed transition probabilities between states

Initial state: 30 days: 25 exercised (E), 5 did not (N)

Transition probabilities: 

* E -> E .8
* E -> N .2
* N -> N .75
* N -> E .25

```{r}
# build the transition matrix for the model
transMatrix <- matrix(c(.8, .2, .25, .75), nrow=2)
transMatrix
# represent the initial state in the exercise matrix
exercise <- matrix(c(5/30, 25/30), nrow=2)
exercise
```

Alter the number of iterations.

After 6 iterations, the model stabilizes at around 54% to 46%. After 5000 iterations, about the same. 

```{r}
for (i in 1:10){
  exercise <- transMatrix %*% exercise
  print(paste("exercise at i=", i, ":", format(round(exercise[1,], 2))))
}
exercise
```
