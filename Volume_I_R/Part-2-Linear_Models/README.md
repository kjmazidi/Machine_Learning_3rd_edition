# The Machine Learning Handbooks
## Companion Code to the series
### Author: Dr. KJG Mazidi


This is the 3rd iteration of my machine learning book, significantly expanded into 4 volumes. 

- Volume I focuses on R and the many aspects of data exploration that are important skills for machine learning practitioners as well as data scientists; in addition, Volume I explores linear and statistical methods of machine learning

- Volume II focuses on Python and the sklearn platform for additional machine learning algorithms

- Volume III provides an introduction to TensorFlow and the Hugging Face platform

- Volume IV is all about PyTorch, which is rapidly becoming the most popular deep learning platform
